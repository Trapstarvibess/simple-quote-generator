# Contributing to Simple Quote Generator

We welcome contributions to make this quote generator even better! Here's how you can help:

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to contribute is by adding new inspirational quotes to the `quotes.txt` file.

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Clone your forked repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Trapstarvibess/simple-quote-generator.git
    cd simple-quote-generator
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/add-new-quotes
    ```
    (Or `bugfix/fix-typo` if you're correcting an error).
4.  **Add your quotes:**
    Open the `quotes.txt` file and add new quotes. Each quote should be on a new line. You can also add the author if you like, e.g., `Your quote here. -- Author Name`.
5.  **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add quotes.txt
    git commit -m "feat: Add new inspirational quotes"
    ```
6.  **Push your branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/add-new-quotes
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    Go to your forked repository on GitHub and open a pull request to the `main` branch of the original `simple-quote-generator` repository.

## What to Include in Your Pull Request

* **Clear Title:** Something like "Add new quotes" or "Fix typo in quote."
* **Description:** Briefly explain what you've added or changed.
